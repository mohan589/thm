In case if the target box does not have a generated id_rsa file (or you simply don't have reading permissions for it), you can still gain stable ssh access. All you need to do is generate your own id_rsa key on your system and include an associated key into authorized_keys file on the target machine. 
Execute ssh-keygen and you should see id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files appear in your own .ssh folder. Copy the content of the id_rsa.pub file and put it inside the authorized_key file on the target machine (located in .ssh folder). After that, connect to the machine using your id_rsa file.
